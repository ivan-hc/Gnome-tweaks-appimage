This repository creates and distributes the unofficial Appimage of Gnome-tweaks.

From here you can download the scripts to build on top of [JuNest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest), the lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, on top of any other Linux distro.

---------------------------------

### NOTE: this is an experimental Appimage and it is not ready to be used

To improve it, extract the AppImage using the option `--appimage-extract` and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/ArchImage#troubleshooting)
